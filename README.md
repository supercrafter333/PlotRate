**With this simple plugin you can rate the plots on your plotworld. When a player walk over a rated plot, a title with the reting will send to the player.**

This plugin only works with [MyPlot](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/MyPlot) by [jasonwynn10](https://github.com/jasonwynn10)!

This plugin will be better from time to time. Please send feature requests if you will a new feature on PlotRate. I'll try to add all feature requests.
